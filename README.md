# Starter Web Repo

This repository is for showing how Git and GitHub work. Indeed: they do work. Pending a giant solar flare or similar global tech- and/or bio-apocalypse, they should continue to work for some time. At the very least till the end of the day.

## Purpose

Sample website with plenty of files for demos

## Modding 

It's by Joel. He's modding it. 

## Deployment

Well we're just putting it on the forked sample repo of course.
