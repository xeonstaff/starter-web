Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart! Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything.

I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here. I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over!

This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. Don't ever give an order like that again. Not while I'm alive. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child.

And then....well, you know very well what happened after all of that was said and done at the end of the day.
